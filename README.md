# afLSystem
- An L-system consists of an alphabet of symbols that can be used to make strings, 
a collection of production rules that expand each symbol into some larger string of symbols, 
an initial "axiom" string from which to begin construction, and a mechanism for translating the generated strings into geometric structures. 

An L-system can  :
* model the morphology of a variety of organisms 
* be used to generate self-similar fractals
